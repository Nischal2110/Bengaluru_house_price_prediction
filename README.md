# Bangalore_House_Price_Prediction
This project focuses on applying data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict house prices in Bengaluru, India. By leveraging key real estate features such as location, square footage, and other relevant attributes, the project aims to build a robust predictive model capable of estimating house prices with improved accuracy and reduced prediction errors.

**Predictive Modeling**: Developed a machine learning model that estimates house prices with a 25% improvement in accuracy over previous methods.

**Data Analysis**: Performed comprehensive data analysis and feature engineering using key attributes like location and square footage, resulting in a 30% reduction in prediction errors.

**Data Cleaning & Pre-processing**: Cleaned and transformed raw data using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy, ensuring high-quality input for model training.

**Model Enhancement**: Utilized machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, and implemented continuous model refinement, leading to a 20% improvement in model accuracy and a 15% reduction in prediction errors over time.
